# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
We are trying to determine whether refactoring code makes the given VBA script run faster. 

### Results

These are the results before refractoring:

I refactored the VBA code and measured performance.

One can see that the refractored code ran slower than the original one. 

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

>There are a lot of advantages to refractoring. For exaple, factoring code generaly makes it run faster, it automaticaly adapts to new entered data, makes it easier to manipulate large amounts of data. On the other hand, if I was working with a small amount of information, refractoring will be unnecessary work and a waste of time especially if you only plan to use it once. In this case it would be a disadvatage. 


- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

> One pro I can think of is that if I was to create a new spreadsheet for a different year itâ€™d automatically work with the same code. 
> One the other hand, we can see that refractoring made the code run slower.
