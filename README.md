I refactored the VBA code and measured performance. 

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

>There are a lot of advantages. For exaple, factoring code makes it run faster, it automaticaly adapts to new entered data, makes it easier to manipulate large amounts of data. On the other hand, if I was working with a small amount of information, refractoring will be unnecessary work and a waste of time especially if you only plan to use it once. In this case it would be a disadvatage. 


- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

>Refractoring code is useful in this situation. For example, if I was to create a new spreadsheet for a different year itâ€™d automatically work with the same code.
